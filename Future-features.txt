add a OTP verification handler and a otp verification component (js) file and make appropriate HTTP requests , here are the steps
Install and configure the necessary packages: You will need to install and configure packages such as nodemailer and jsonwebtoken to send emails and generate OTPs respectively.

Create an API endpoint to generate and send OTP: 
Create an API endpoint to generate and send OTP to 
the user's email or mobile number. You can use a library 
like node-otp to generate OTPs. Once the OTP 
is generated, you can send it to the user's email 
or mobile number using nodemailer.

Create an API endpoint to verify OTP: Create another 
API endpoint to verify the OTP entered by the user
. You will need to store the OTP and the user's email 
or mobile number in a database (such as MongoDB) 
to verify the OTP entered by the user. Once the OTP is
 verified, you can send a JSON web token (JWT) to the user.

Implement the OTP verification process in the client-side: 
In the client-side, you can create a form 
where the user enters the OTP sent to their email or mobile number.
 Once the user enters the OTP, you 
can send a request to the server to verify the OTP. If the OTP is verified, 
the server will send a JWT 
to the client, which can be stored in the client's local storage.

Implement authentication using JWT: 
Once the user is authenticated using OTP, you can use the JWT to 
authenticate the user for subsequent requests.
 You can include the JWT in the authorization header of
 each request to the server.

Overall, setting up OTP verification in a MERN stack application requires implementing several components,
 such as generating and sending OTP, verifying OTP, and implementing the authentication process using JWT.
  However, once set up, this can provide a secure and reliable way to authenticate users in your application.
